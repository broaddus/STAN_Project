Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Stanford Robotics Club's STAN project.

STAN is the automation network in PRL-36, the Robotics Club's primary working space.

STAN's purposes are:
1) to assist club members with shop tasks
2) to look, sound, and feel awesome

This repository should contain all software for STAN PCs, mobile devices, and microcontrollers.

STAN is an evolving modular project - see subREADMEs for more information on specific features.
